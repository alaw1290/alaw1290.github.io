I love putting my ideas to work and challenging my skills and knowledge.

I'm fascinated by the potential I find in projects and excited about creating and leaving meaningful change in the world.

My goals are to advance our understanding of the world around us through data and develop solutions with that understanding.

After graduating from Boston University in 2017 with a BA in Computer Science and Economics, I joined Optum as a Data Scientist, where I'm applying ML initiatives to the healthcare space.
