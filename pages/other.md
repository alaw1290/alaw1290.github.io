I'm an avid sailor and badminton player (come to BU Fitrec on Sunday mornings!)

I help mentor students and other young professionals around Boston as part of the Taiwanese American Professionals association

I spend a lot of time watching old movies, memorizing history trivia, and getting invovled in many other pursuits
